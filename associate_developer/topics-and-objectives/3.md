**Demonstrate the ability to customize the Magento UI using themes.**
</br>*A.* High-level steps to create a theme and change styles
	1. Set your Magento application to the developer mode.
	2. In the file system, add a new theme inheriting from Magento Blank or Luma.
	3. Apply your theme
	4. Decide which CSS compilation mode you will use. Compilation modes are described in the following topics:
	- Detailed description: Styles debugging
	- Practical illustration: Simple style changes with client-side Less compilation vs. server-side
	5. Customize styles. To learn how, check out the following sources:
	- CSS chapter of this book
	- Simple ways to customize a themeâ€™s styles

**Q. When would you create a new theme?**
</br>*A.* Luma inherits from Blank, which contains all the basic functionality and styling required for a theme. You can use either Luma or Blank for your storeview, if there is literally nothing you want to change in their design. But if there is something you want to improve, the only recommended way is creating a new theme. It can inherit from Blank or Luma so you can preserve all you need, and change or add whatever is required.

**Q. How do you define theme hierarchy for a project?**
</br>*A.* Magento has a hierarchy in place for its themes, which tells the system where to look for files if multiple themes are active on different stores on your website. Website -> Store (yourstore.com) -> Store View. 

 Imagine that your store has a theme called newtheme installed at the store view level. The Magento theme here requests a file called styles.css in the most specific interface and package first, so if you have a custom theme enabled, Magento will look in /skin/frontend/default/newtheme first. If it's not found in these directories, Magento looks in the default interfaces next: /app/design/frontend/default/default or /skin/frontend/default/default. Next, Magento will look in the base directories: /app/design/frontend/base/default or /skin/frontend/base/default. If the specified file is not found after that, Magento will encounter a rendering error.

So, the deeper down the hierarchy tree of themes the file is, the more specific it is and the more precedence it takes over other more general files.
