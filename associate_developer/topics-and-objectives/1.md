## **1.1** Describe the Magento module-based architecture

**Describe module architecture.**
[DevDocs- create-a-new-module](https://devdocs.magento.com/videos/fundamentals/create-a-new-module/)
[DevDocs- package_module](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/extension-dev-guide/package/package_module.html)

**Q.What are the significant steps to add a new module?**
</br>*A.* To create a module, you need to complete the following high-level steps:
1. Create the module folder.
2. Create the etc/module.xml file.
3. Create the registration.php file.
4. Run the bin/magento setup:upgrade script to install the new module.
5. Check that the module is working.

**Q. What are the different Composer package types?**
</br>*A.* The Magento application uses Composer packages to distribute, install, and upgrade components in an application instance.
1. metapackage: Technically, a Composer package type, not a Magento component type. A metapackage consists of only a composer.json file that specifies a list of components and their dependencies. For example, both Magento Open Source and Magento Commerce are metapackages.
2. magento2-module: Code that modifies Magento application behavior. You can upload a single module to the Magento Marketplace or your module can be dependent on some parent package.
3. magento2-theme: Code that modifies the look and feel of the storefront or Magento Admin.
4. magento2-language: Translations for the storefront or Admin.

**Q.When would you place a module in the `app/code` folder versus another location?**
</br>*A.* There are two possible locations for modules in Magento 2: the app/code folder and the vendor folder
If you build a module for a specific project, it is best to choose the app/code folder and commit to the projectâ€™s repository.
If you build an extension to be reused, it is better to use composer to create it, and put your module in the vendor/<YOUR_VENDOR>/module-something folder.

## **1.2** Describe the Magento directory structure

**Describe the Magento directory structure.**

**Q.** What are the naming conventions, and how are namespaces established? 

**Q.** How can you identify the files responsible for some functionality?


## **1.3** Utilize configuration and configuration variables scope

**Determine how to use configuration files in Magento.**

**Q.** Which configuration files are important in the development cycle?

**Describe development in the context of website and store scopes.**

**Q.** How do you identify the configuration scope for a given variable? 

**Q.** How do native Magento scopes (for example, **price** or **inventory**) affect development and decision-making processes?

**Demonstrate an ability to add different values for different scopes.**

**Q.** How can you fetch a system configuration value programmatically? 

**Q.** How can you override system configuration values for a given store using **XML** configuration?


## **1.4** Demonstrate how to use dependency injection (DI)

**Demonstrate the ability to use the dependency injection concept in Magento development.**

**Q.** How are objects realized in code? 

**Q.** Why is it important to have a centralized object creation process?

**Identify how to use DI configuration files for customizing Magento.**

**Q.** How can you override a native class, inject your class into another object, and use other techniques available in `di.xml` (for example, `virtualTypes`)?

**Given a scenario, determine how to obtain an object using the ObjectManager object.**

**Q.** How would you obtain a class instance from different places in the code?


## **1.5** Demonstrate ability to use plugins

**Demonstrate an understanding of plugins.**

**Q.** How are plugins used in core code? 

**Q.** How can they be used for customizations?


## **1.6** Configure event observers and scheduled jobs

**Demonstrate how to create a customization using an event observer.**

**Q.** How are observers registered? 

**Q.** How are they scoped for frontend or backend? 

**Q.** How are automatic events created, and how should they be used? 

**Q.** How are scheduled jobs configured?


## **1.7** Utilize the CLI

**Describe the usage of `bin/magento` commands in the development cycle.** 

**Q.** Which commands are available? 

**Q.** How are commands used in the development cycle?


## **1.8** Describe how extensions are installed and configured

**Q.** How would you install and verify an extension by a customer's request?
